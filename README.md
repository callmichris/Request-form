# **ICT REQUEST FORM SYSTEM - README**  

## **Project Overview**  
The **ICT Request Form System** is designed to streamline the process of submitting and managing ICT-related service requests within an organization. It allows employees (Regular Staff) to submit requests for IT support, while ICT Officers can track, manage, and resolve these requests efficiently. The system enhances communication, reduces delays, and improves transparency in ICT service management.
